Albert Yu: Please note this branch is NOT being used.
Albert Yu: Mohan checked-in a big change into MASTER, while Albert was working on this branch.
Albert Yu: Thereafter, Albert needed to merge Mohan's work into this branch.
Albert Yu: However, Albert couldn't work out a proper way to submit these big changes back to the GitLab master repo, from his local IntelliJ instance.
Albert Yu: So Albert had to close this branch and begin a fresh one.  He will call it gitlab-ci-yml-fix-2
