In 3022, earth has become hard to live due to a nuclear explosion causing ripples in the earth core.
Due to this explosion the natural stability was destroyed causing multiple global disasters.
Nearly 75% of the earth population was wiped out.
Thus, to survive, earth formed an elite team of explorers to search the vast galaxy for a suitable planet for humanity to survive.
They also build a state-of-the-art spaceship with hyper speed that can travel at a speed faster than light.
Whazam is the captain of the ship and when crossing the xyz planet due to some system malfunction they landed on an unknown planet.
During the decent, the ship fell away from the crew and one person must reach the ship and fix it so that everyone can reach home.

They might encounter some alien life form which may or may not be friendly.

The goal is to reach the ship whilst detecting enemy/alien lifeforms.
 When the crew member approach any alien lifeforms the user must either fight or have a friendly conversation.
