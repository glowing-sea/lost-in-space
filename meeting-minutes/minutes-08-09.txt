William go travelling and we briefly talk about what we should do in future

Currently we have:
- Albert: create CI and read instructions about how to build our own runner.
- Haoting: compiled a TODO list
- Haoting: successfully build a game skeleton and make a merge request
- Zhishang: create some user stories
- Team: approve Haoting's merge request and merge it to main. We decide to do branch out and do the work on to-do list individually.
- Team: discussed unit test
TASKS
- Since everyone has different expectation, we decide that everyone can add features we want with branch out
- Zhishang will finish the enemy branch and unit testing by 8/9/2022. Then he will do a merge request (finished on time)
- Everyone are suggest to review other's merge request and see if program runs
